**Effective Date:** 2026-Jan-03

## 1. Information We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

The extension does not:
- Track users
- Record browsing history
- Collect analytics
- Send data to any external server owned by the developer

All operations happen within the user’s browser.

## 2. Permissions

The extension uses the following Chrome permissions:

- `activeTab`  
  Used to read links from the currently active page when the user opens the extension.

- `tabs`  
  Used to open a temporary Google Search tab to verify index status.

- `scripting`  
  Used to inject scripts into the active tab and Google Search results pages for index detection.

- `storage`  
  Used to store index check results **locally** so results persist while the tab remains open.

- `https://www.google.com/*`  
  Required to perform Google Search queries to determine index status.

These permissions are used **only** to provide the extension’s core functionality. No collected data leaves the browser.

## 3. How Your Data Is Used

All processing is performed **locally on your device**.

The extension may temporarily:
- Read URLs from the active page
- Store index results in Chrome’s local storage (per tab)

The extension does **not** collect or store:
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Login credentials
- Cookies
- Page content beyond URLs
- Location data
- Usage metrics

Local storage is automatically cleared when the related browser tab is closed.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The extension interacts with **Google Search** only to check whether a URL appears in search results.

No data is:
- Sent to the developer
- Shared with advertisers
- Logged by third-party analytics tools
